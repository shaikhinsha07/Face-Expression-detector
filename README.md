# Face-Expression-detector
Expected Result would be to develop a system which can analyse the image and detect the expression of a person.
A user interface will pop up and ask the user to select any image using Select Image button and then it will show selected file.
Then the output window will show selected image using Image Selected button and display button will show the result i.e expression of the image selected.
Humans have always had the innate ability to recognize and
distinguish between faces. Now computers are able to do the
same. This opens up tons of applications. Face expression
detection can be used to recognize human emotion. Face
expression detection is a heavily researched topic and there are
tons of resources online. We have tried multiple open source
projects to find the ones that are simplest to implement while
being accurate. We have also created a GUI for detection,
recognition and emotion prediction on any input image
